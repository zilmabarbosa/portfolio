This was my first assignment in Data Preparation, where we were asked to execute Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation and, finally, apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to reduce the dimension of the dataset while maintaining 99.5% of its variance.

The dataset is about the Air Pressure System (APS) failure of Scania Trucks and can be found on this page:
