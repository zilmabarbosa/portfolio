It also sets the plot in a frame other than a black line. The figure background is set to white when necessary in order to remove the transparency of the png files that can be generated from the Jupiter Notebook outputs; the png files can be easier observed and read without any transparency. The selection of colours for the plots themselves will be explained in detail according to each one.\n\nIn respect of typography, the Google font Play was the chosen one for Plotly plots. Play is a minimalistic sans-serif typeface that has a corporate, yet friendly appearance with high legibility and readability (Google Fonts, n.d.). Lucida Console was chosen for most of the Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud and Altair titles and legends; and Lucida Sans Unicode, from the same family as Lucida Console, is being used for ticks with long texts as it has a tighter kerning. Lucida keeps some similarities with Play that will endorse a high level of unity across plots of different libraries.

For example, the highest value is 42 as the minimum age for the game \"South African Railroads\". On the website BoarGameGeek, this information is unavailable. By expanding the search on the web, an article about this game says:\n> Who can play? Age recommendation is 42+. That’s John Bohrer’s wry sense of humour, but then again, this is a somewhat demanding game. I’m sure my 11-year-old son would grasp the rules without issues, but I’m fairly sure he’d be pretty far from actually playing well. [2]\n* At least one game has the highest \"min_playtime\" of 60000 minutes. At first, this might look like a mistake that became an outlier (as the number is much higher than the third quartile one), but we can easily check that the information is actually correct. By searching the name of the game \"The Campaign for North Africa\" on the website BoardGameGeek[3], it is possible to confirm that the minimum time of 60000 minutes is correct.\n* Regarding the distribution of the \"year_published\", it can be seen that over the years, the number of games published increased exponentially, as the last 3 values (50%, 75% and max) are close to one another and much further from the min. This can be better observed through the boxplots that follow in the next section. A similar distribution happens for \"average_rating\" and the opposite happens with \"users_rated\", where the numbers lean towards the min and away from the max.\n* Finally, it is noticed that 558 entries for the variable \"designer\" are filled as \"uncredited\".\n\n[2] https://mikkosgameblog.com/2017/11/south-african-railroads/\n\n[3] https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/campaign-north-africa-desert-war-1940-43","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Obtaining a summary of the dataset basic statistics for the numerical columns\n\ndf.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.109920Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.110264Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.155487Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.110233Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.154642Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Obtaining a summary of the dataset basic statistics for the categorical columns\n\ndf.describe(include = 'object').T","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.156630Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.157457Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.244063Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.157418Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.242854Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking the game with highest \"min_age\"\n\ndf.sort_values(by = ['min_age'], ascending = False).head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.245302Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.245669Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.278020Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.245636Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.276686Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking the game with highest \"min_playtime\"\n\ndf.sort_values(by = ['min_playtime'], ascending = False).head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.279474Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.279869Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.313748Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.279835Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.312039Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Duplicates**\n\nWhile checking for duplicated rows, there were no duplicates found. However, as seen in the previous section, the columns \"max_playtime\" and \"playing_time\" have the same statistic summary. By verifying the duplicates in the columns using the transpose property, \"playing_time\" displays the value True, which indicates that this feature is a duplicate of another one. This column is, then, compared with \"max_playtime\" with the function \"equals\", which confirms that they have the same values.\n\nAs seen previously, the feature \"min_playtime\" has values that are very similar to \"max_playtime\" and \"playing_time\". Comparing the two features, it is noticed that 8967 out of 10532 are exactly the same, which is 85% of similarity. This can mean that those values are not being correctly input into the source. Although the values for those features might not be reliable, there is no need to drop the columns of the dataset. It is important, however, to have this in mind if using one of them for visualization or even modelling.\n\nBecause \"game_id\" has a total of 10532 unique values, it would make sense that \"description\" and \"name\" had the same amount of unique values if each row was a distinct board game. However, \"description\" has 10528 unique values and \"name\" has 10357, which means that both features have some duplicated observations. By taking a look at some of these repeated values, it is possible to infer that:\n* Repeated values for \"description\" happen when there is more than one version of the same game.\n* Repeated values for \"name\" can happen for distinct games with the same name but different mechanics or updated versions of the same game, for example.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to infer that all rows indeed represent unique games.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Ckecking for duplicates in rows\n\ndf.duplicated().sum()\nprint('There are a total of ' + (str(df.duplicated().sum()) + ' duplicates in the dataset.'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.314939Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.315764Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.434896Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.315726Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.433389Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking for duplicates in columns\n\ndf.T.duplicated()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.436330Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.436671Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.579000Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:16.436641Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.577758Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking if columns \"max_playtime\" and \"playing_time\" are duplicates\n\ndf['max_playtime'].equals(df['playing_time'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.585817Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.586207Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.594129Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.586164Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.593187Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking when \"max_playtime\" is the same as \"min_playtime\"\n\ndf_time = df[df['max_playtime'] == df['min_playtime']]\ndf_time.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.595241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.595601Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.613183Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.595569Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.612012Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking the total of unique values in the columns \"game_id\", \"description\" and \"name\"\n\ndf['game_id'].nunique()\nprint('There are a total of ' + (str(df['game_id'].nunique()) + ' unique values in the \"game_id\" variable.'))\n\ndf['description'].nunique()\nprint('There are a total of ' + (str(df['description'].nunique()) + ' unique values in the \"description\" variable.'))\n\ndf['name'].nunique()\nprint('There are a total of ' + (str(df['name'].nunique()) + ' unique values in the \"name\" variable.'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.614220Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.614613Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.698919Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.614569Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.697852Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Observing the duplicated values in \"description\"\n\ndesc = df['description']\ndf[desc.isin(desc[desc.duplicated()])]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.700112Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.700592Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.741128Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.700526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.739590Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Observing the duplicated values in \"name\"\n\nname = df['name']\ndf[name.isin(name[name.duplicated()])].sort_values('name', ascending = True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.742525Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.742998Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.784375Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.742950Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.783166Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Distribution and outliers**\n\nApart from observing the distribution of the variables through the function \"describe\", a group of boxplots is being used to display the distribution of the previously mentioned features \"year_published\", \"average_rating\" and \"users_rated\". Through this specific type of plot and those 3 examples, it is easier to understand that most of this dataset has a skewed distribution with outliers.\n\nThe boxplots were produced with the library Plotly to make some level of interaction possible. Through the hover tool, details of the distribution can be closely observed such as the values for min, max, mean etc. Zoom is another possible interaction, that can be more useful for the \"user_rated\" plot, which is the most skewed of the three. The legend was deactivated as they are only repeating the X label, thus they are not necessary.\n\nBefore the production, a custom template that will serve for all Plotly graphs was created. The custom template sets fonts and sizes for titles and labels as well as plot and paper (figure) background colour as discussed previously.\n\nAs the plot contains three boxes, the primary colours were selected. In gaming, colours are used to group or separate elements, like differentiating players, for example. For this reason, they need to be easily distinguishable among themselves and among the overall scenario or background (Interama Games, 2016). In this case, the primary colours work perfectly to make the three plots as distinct as possible while creating this link with the gaming atmosphere.\n\nWhile some of the elements are placed to create unity, the variety of colours explicts that the features presented are well distinct from one another as are the primary colours. Variety in design is used to create visual interest and avoid monotony, improving the user's visual experience. One of the many ways of implementing variety is through colours (Chapman, 2019).\n\nThe outliers will not be treated. As previously mentioned, they do not seem to represent an imputation error. If they were removed or replaced, the graphs could mislead decision-making that would be based on a distorted visualization of the facts. They should be treated accordingly, though, when any machine learning model requires so.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a custom template for plotly\n\ncustom_template = {'layout':\n                   go.Layout(\n                       font = {'family': 'Play, monospace',\n                               'size': 12,\n                               'color': '#707070'},\n                       \n                       title = {'font': {'family': 'Play, monospace',\n                                         'size': 18,\n                                          'color': '#1f1f1f'}},\n                       \n                       legend = {'font': {'family': 'Play, monospace',\n                                          'size': 12,\n                                          'color': '#1f1f1f'}},\n                       \n                       plot_bgcolor = '#f2f2f2',\n                       paper_bgcolor = '#ffffff'\n                   )}","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.787453Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.787828Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.807604Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.787794Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.806741Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking the distribution and outliers of the features 'year_published', 'average_rating', 'users_rated'\n\nfig = make_subplots(rows = 1, cols = 3)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Box(y = df['year_published'], name = 'Year Published',\n                    marker_color = 'red', showlegend = False), row = 1, col = 1)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Box(y = df['average_rating'], name = 'Average Rating',\n                    marker_color ='green', showlegend = False), row = 1, col = 2)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Box(y = df['users_rated'], name = 'Users Rated',\n                    marker_color = 'blue', showlegend = False), row = 1, col = 3)\n\nfig.update_layout(height = 800, width = 800,\n                  title_text = 'Distribution of Year Published, Average Rating and Users Rated', template = custom_template)\n\nfig.update_layout(title = {\n    'y':0.95,\n    'x':0.5})\n\nfig.show()","metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.808913Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.809716Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.950331Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.809669Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-21T15:25:18.949443Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Missing values**\n\nTo better understand the proportions of missing values per column, a bar chart was plotted.

Various competitive games make use of two factions that compete against each other and this dichotomy demands a clear visual communication that is usually represented with two clearly different colours (Interama Games, 2016).\n\nThe plot do not show much initially. As \"max_playtime\" scale is impacted by some outliers, the dots are overlapping a lot and the line looks completely horizontal, showing no upwards or downwards trend. A second graph is plotted, then, including a log scale along the axis y, which improves the visualization as the dots are overlapping less than before.

What is the distribution of game categories?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this dataset, the column \"category\" has initially 3861 unique values. This can be explained by the fact that each game is associated with more than one category in the same observation, creating, then, multiple combinations of categories. In order to analyse individual categories, the functions \"str.split\" and \"explode\" are applied to the initial list and all the observations are split, where there is a comma, and exploded in new rows. After this step, 84 unique categories are identified with their respective count. Althout 84 is still a large number, it is much smaller than 3861.\n\nAs the list of unique categories has 84 items, this would be a lot of information for a pie chart. Hence, in this case, Seaborn \"countplot\" is being used to display, through bars, the counts of observations for each categorical bin. Once more, blue and orange were chosen as the colours of the bars. In this scenario, the dichotomy of the colours separate the most frequent categories from the less frequent ones. The \"xticks\" labels were rotated in 90 degrees to make it possible the display of all of them. From the bar chart plotted, it is possible to see that the most frequent category is \"Card Game\".\n\nOne way to plot a normalized distribution of the proportions of the categories is by applying the parameter \"normalize = True\" in the value counts list, which will transform the absolute count into a proportion. Then, Seaborn \"kdeplot\" is used to plot the distribution of the proportions, with the parameter \"cut\" set to zero, as no count can be negative. \"Card Game\" will be, for example, at the very end of the tail, as its frequency is 2981 out of the total of 27514 categories (over 10% or 0.10 as seen in the x-axis of the graph). In this case, it is possible to observe a highly skewed distribution.\n\nFinally, another interesting way of displaying the frequency of the categories is through a word cloud. Although it is a less corporate format, the word cloud presented in the shape of the most frequent category makes it very quick to understand its importance for the industry. The \"unique_cat_list\" from the previous distribution graphs was exported to a .csv file in order to use it with the \"WordCloud\" library. The word cloud is generated with the background set to white colour, maximum of words to match the number of unique categories, a contour of blue colour and a colourful colormap called \"prism\", to facilitate the distinction between the categories. Also, an image of cards was imported and used as a mask, so the word cloud would be inside it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking the total of unique values in the column

This new dataframe is then grouped by year while aggregating the average rate by the mean, generating a unique mean rating per year.\n\nThe \"df_year_avgrate\" generates, then, two new datasets: \"df_year_avgrate_mean_older\" which contains all the observations prior to 1993 and \"df_year_avgrate_mean_newer\" which keeps all the observations from 1993 onwards.\n\nAgain, Seaborn was the chosen library to plot a timeline of the mean average rating over the year. The final plot is a combination of two line plots for the \"df_year_avgrate_mean_older\" and \"df_year_avgrate_mean_newer\". And, once more, blue and orange were the chosen colours to show the contrast between older and newer games while keeping the visual unity with other plots.\n\nWith those two lines alone, it is already possible to visualize that older games have, instead, a lower mean average rating.

The cumulative growth rate reaches 1037% (10.37) in 2016, after a 17% decrease in regards to the previous year.\n\nTo find these values, the original dataset \"df\" was used. In this original dataset, all values for \"game_id\" are unique, which means each line represents a unique game. So, the variable \"count\" was created and the number 1 is assigned to each row to represent the count for each unique game. After this, the two columns needed for this graph (\"year_published\" and \"count\") were assigned to a new dataframe called \"df_games_year\", which was sorted in ascending order by year and then grouped by year with the sum of games per year. Finally, the column \"pct_change\" was created in this new dataframe, by applying the homonym pandas function to the column \"count\", which calculates the percentage of change between the current and a prior element.\n\nA line graph was, then, plotted with the cumulative percentage change throughout the years. This time, Plotly was used to allow some interaction. By moving the mouse cursor along the line, it is possible to see the specific percentage change for every year from 1951 to 2016. Since 1950 is the initial year, there is no prior value to which it can be compared.\n\nGreen is commonly related to health, healing or teammates in gaming (DVNC TECH LLC, 2018).
