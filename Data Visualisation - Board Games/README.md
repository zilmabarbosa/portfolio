This project was a college assignment where the objective was to answer 5 questions and produce and answer 2 extra ones by using Data Visualisation techniques.

All data wrangling, and visualisation design decisions should have been rationalised.

Here, I kept only some notes I found more relevant to share. I also had to make some workarounds to display Plotly and Altair plots here on GitHub, as mentioned in the markdown language. If you want to check the original interactive outputs of the plots, you can go to my <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/code/zilmabezerra/data-visualisation-board-games#Data-Visualisation"> Kaggle page</a>.
