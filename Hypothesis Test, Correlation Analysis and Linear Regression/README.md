This was my final Statistics assignment, where we were asked to choose a dataset, perform a hypothesis test, carry out a correlation analysis between 2 variables, and build a linear regression model using Numpy Polyfit.

The chosen dataset was about CO2 Emissions in Canada and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles
