This file is part of a college assignment, where the objective was applying recommendation systems and produce a dashboard, which I built on Streamlit.
Streamlit files can be acessed in the <a href = "https://github.com/zilmabezerra/streamlit">streamlit repository</a> and the web app can be accessed <a href = "https://zilmabezerra-dvt.streamlit.app/">here</a>.

I also had to make some workarounds to display Plotly and Folium plots here on GitHub, as mentioned in the markdown language. If you want to check the original interactive outputs of the plots, you can go to my <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/code/zilmabezerra/data-visualisation-board-games#Data-Visualisation">Kaggle page</a>.
