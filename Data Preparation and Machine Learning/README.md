This was my final integrated assignment for Data Preparation and Machine Learning disciplines. Its objective was to understand, explore and prepare the data, and choose between classification or clustering algorithms (supervised or unsupervised learning) to predict fraudulent bids at the online retailer eBay.
Specifically for Data Preparation, it was suggested to explore the possibility of dimensionally reducing the dataset, by applying both LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
For Machine Learning, we should provide a logical justification for the specific choice of machine learning approach (supervised or unsupervised learning). We were also asked to compare different algorithms and their results.
My approach was to do research to get a deep understanding of the dataset first of all. After this, I decided on the machine learning approach and applied the chosen algorithms in different stages of the data preparation process in order to compare the results.
