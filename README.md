# About me

I am a multilingual professional (English, Spanish and Portuguese) who has embarked on a new journey to be a Data Analyst after more than 10 years of experience in Marketing and Advertising. In 2020, I moved to Ireland to both improve my English, and have the experience of living abroad. In 2022, I decided to change careers and started a Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics for Business, where I recently achieved a First-class Honours degree. I am also studying Project Management. I believe these three areas together are really powerful and useful to help businesses succeed.

On this page, you can see some of my college assignments and, hopefully, some of my work in the near future.
