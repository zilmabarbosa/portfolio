Committed professional with over 14 years of marketing, advertising and customer-facing work experience who is now embracing the data science career.

I am currently doing a Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics for Business (QQI level 8) at CCT, in Dublin, aiming to achieve a first-class honours degree in February 2023.

The skills I have developed throughout my career in marketing are helping me to develop as a Data Analyst now. Detail-oriented, organised, analytical and with excellent communication skills, including aesthetic sense for visual presentations.

I also consider myself a fast learner and my curiosity helps me with this. Learning Python has been exciting and I believe I have already achieved a good level of knowledge here, although I know this is an endless journey.

On this page, you can see my first college assignments and, hopefully, some of my work in the near future.
